This is an attempt to make our own AI health coach using langgraph and langchain.

## END GOAL
> Make an AI health coach that can help users with their healh and fitness based on real world data, realistic workout plans that are personalized to their goals. 

## Development Journey

### v0.0 
- our very first version of the AI health coach is a cli version that uses langgraph and openai to generate health instructions for users. It seems to work pretty well.
- Coach should first ask about the user's goal before giving any workout plans

### v0.1
- persisting conversation history

### v0.2
- Coach should be able to write it down and create a document file for the user so that users can refer to it easily in the future. 
- Coach should be able to remember the user's goal and their workout history and health data and use it to give personalized workout, diet plans. 
- Health Coach should be aware of different types of diets and workouts with real world data and scientific studies. 
- Coach should be able to look for real world data and new scientific studies if the coach doesn't have enough information to give a personalized plan. 


#### Improvements needed
- Coach should be able to check in with the user and ask if they are following the plan and if they are making progress. 
- Coach should be able to write articles and share it with the user to help them understand their health and fitness journey.
